The goal of pitagoras is to be a dummy package that I use to understand R package building
It uses as example a single function called my_shannon(), that calculates Shannon diversity

## Installation

You can install the development version of pitagoras like so:

``` r
install_github("thalesdrago/pitagoras")

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}

pitagoras::my_shannon(x)
```
